# Project Progress

## Current Status

The FluentCMS.Repositories project initial implementation has been completed. The core interfaces and all three database implementations (MongoDB, SQL Server, and SQLite) have been developed.

- Memory Bank documentation has been established
- Core requirements have been defined
- Architecture and patterns have been outlined
- Technical context has been established
- Solution structure created
- Core interfaces and models implemented
- All three database implementations created

## What Works

- Project structure with all required projects has been set up:
  - FluentCMS.Repositories.Abstractions
  - FluentCMS.Repositories.MongoDb
  - FluentCMS.Repositories.SqlServer
  - FluentCMS.Repositories.Sqlite
  - Corresponding test projects

- Core interfaces and models:
  - IBaseEntity interface
  - IBaseEntityRepository<T> interface with full CRUD operations
  - Query models for filtering, sorting, and pagination
  - Custom exception types

- MongoDB implementation:
  - MongoDbRepository<T> implementation
  - MongoDB-specific configuration
  - DI registration through extension methods

- SQL Server implementation:
  - SqlServerRepository<T> implementation
  - DbContext configuration
  - DI registration through extension methods

- SQLite implementation:
  - SqliteRepository<T> implementation
  - DbContext configuration
  - DI registration through extension methods

- Documentation:
  - README with usage examples

## What's Left to Build

### Testing

- [ ] Implement unit tests for MongoDB repository
- [ ] Implement unit tests for SQL Server repository
- [ ] Implement unit tests for SQLite repository
- [ ] Set up integration tests for all implementations

### Documentation and Samples

- [ ] Add inline code comments to improve documentation
- [ ] Create sample applications demonstrating real-world usage
- [ ] Add benchmarks for different implementations

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated testing
- [ ] Set up NuGet package publishing

## Evolution of Key Decisions

- Decided to implement separate projects for each database provider to maintain clear separation of concerns and dependencies
- Used generics with constraints to enforce entity requirements
- Implemented common interface across all database implementations for consistent API
- Used repository pattern with query/filter options for flexible data access

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this point, but more testing is needed.

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to implement comprehensive tests for all repository implementations and create sample applications to demonstrate usage patterns.
