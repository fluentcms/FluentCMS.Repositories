# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

FluentCMS.Repositories has progressed from the initial planning phase to having a complete implementation of core interfaces and all three database providers (MongoDB, SQL Server, and SQLite).

## Recent Changes

- Created the complete solution structure with all required projects
- Implemented core interfaces and models in the Abstractions project:
  - IBaseEntity interface
  - IBaseEntityRepository<T> interface
  - Query and sorting models
  - Custom exception types
- Developed MongoDB repository implementation with full CRUD support
- Implemented SQL Server and SQLite repositories using Entity Framework Core
- Added extension methods for DI registration for all providers
- Created README with usage examples and documentation
- Updated progress tracking in the memory bank

## Active Decisions

### Implementation Patterns
- Using generics with constraints to enforce entity requirements
- Standardizing error handling across all implementations
- Keeping database-specific implementation details encapsulated
- Using extension methods for clean DI registration

### Architecture Choices
- Implemented separate libraries for each database provider to:
  - Minimize dependencies in consumer applications
  - Allow for database-specific optimizations
  - Enable independent versioning of each implementation

### API Design
- Consistent API surface across all implementations
- Flexible query capabilities with the same patterns for all databases
- Strong typing for filtering and sorting
- Support for both simple and complex querying patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Implement unit tests for MongoDB, SQL Server, and SQLite implementations
   - Set up integration tests with real database instances
   - Add test coverage reports

2. **Sample Applications**:
   - Create example projects demonstrating real-world usage
   - Show how to switch between different database providers
   - Demonstrate advanced query patterns

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile each implementation
   - Add benchmarks for comparison
   - Optimize critical paths

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up automated build and test
   - Configure NuGet package publishing

## Key Patterns and Preferences

- Generic repository pattern with type constraints
- Full asynchronous implementation for all operations
- LINQ expression-based filtering for type safety
- Clean DI registration via extension methods
- Consistent error handling with custom exceptions

## Project Insights

- The repository pattern provides a good abstraction over different database technologies
- Entity Framework Core provides a consistent API for relational databases
- MongoDB requires different approaches for queries and updates
- Having a standardized repository interface helps maintain consistent code across an application
