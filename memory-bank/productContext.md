# Product Context

## Purpose and Problem Statement

FluentCMS.Repositories exists to solve common challenges in data access layer implementation:

1. **Reducing Boilerplate Code**: Eliminates the need to write repetitive CRUD operations for each entity type in an application.

2. **Database Flexibility**: Provides a consistent API while allowing applications to switch between different database technologies (MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite) with minimal code changes.

3. **Simplified Query Interface**: Offers a standardized way to query data with filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities across different database providers.

4. **Clean Architecture Support**: Facilitates clean architecture by providing a clear separation between domain models and data persistence.

## Target Usage

FluentCMS.Repositories is designed for:

- .NET developers building applications with a structured domain model
- Projects that may need to switch database technologies or support multiple database types
- Applications following clean architecture or domain-driven design principles
- Systems where consistent data access patterns are important across different parts of the application

## User Experience Goals

From a developer perspective, using FluentCMS.Repositories should:

1. **Feel Natural**: Integrate seamlessly with standard C# and .NET patterns and practices
2. **Be Intuitive**: Provide a clear, easily understood API that follows consistent patterns
3. **Reduce Complexity**: Abstract away database-specific implementation details
4. **Be Extensible**: Allow for customization where needed while providing sensible defaults
5. **Maintain Performance**: Provide optimized implementations for each database type

## Integration Context

FluentCMS.Repositories is expected to:

- Work within the larger FluentCMS ecosystem
- Be consumed by various application types (web, API, desktop)
- Support dependency injection for easy service registration
- Coexist with other data access mechanisms when needed
